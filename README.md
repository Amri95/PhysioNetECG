# Atrial Fibrillation Classification from a short single lead ECG recording

This repository contain the code for the Human Data Analytics project. The goal of the project is to classify Atrial Fibrillation from a single lead ECG recording ([Challenge](#https://physionet.org/challenge/2017/)).


### TO DO
- [ ] Smarter data preparation: there are records ranging from 3000 to 18000 samples, should consider smaller sequences? For example sequences containing 10 R waves.
- [ ] Augment data and generate new records for the noise class
- [ ] ...
